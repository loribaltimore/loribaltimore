Hey, I'm @loribaltimore and I am currently teaching myself Web Development to pursue a career transition into the tech industry!
I'm uploading some of my projects here to show off for internships I apply for. I have a couple of games and a web application.
The games are from earlier in my learning journey and the web application is the most recent project I've spent considerable time on.
There are some kinks in my projects, because they are not totally complete. Their functionality should showcase my abilities and whatever kinks there
are can be reduced to small conditional statements that haven't been put in yet. While I'm great with Bootstrap and HTML, I do not spend a considerable
amount of time on formatting and styling. That's because writing logic is more interesting to me.

If you want to collaborate or give some pointers you can reach me at hvp3rwvv3@gmail.com!
